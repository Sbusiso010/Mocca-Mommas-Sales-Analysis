### Project Overview

The project analyzes a coffee shop's sales data, focusing on customer preferences, product perfomance, and inventory management. It highlights the top-selling coffee types, key customers, and popular sizes.

### Tools

- Excel
   - Data Cleaning and Preparation.
   - Data Analysis.
   - Creating Reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which is the top-selling coffee type?
- Which is the top-selling roast type?
